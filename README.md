# CS32 projects

## Project1 "Zion"
A game in which the player fights against many robots in an restricted area. Different objects are required to split into different header files and implementation files.

## Project2 "Anagram"
A program that you look up all the possible permutations of a word in a dictionary using recursion algorithm instead of "for loop". 

## Project3 "People's List"
Implemetation of "linked list" data structure

## Project4 "Iceman"
A realtime interaction game, in which the player is digging for oil in an ice field, but need to avoid or fight back protesters, utilizing items that randomly appear in the ice field. If the protesters get stunned by the player, they will choose a shortest path to the exit, which is implemented in BFS algorithm. Inheritance of objects were also used in the program, as many objects have common attributes.
